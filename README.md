# Topic Detection on Steam Video Games Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
### Akshay Srivatsan - asrivat1@jhu.edu

## Overview:

The goal of this project was to use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to perform topic detection on video games in the Steam library.

Steam is a video game marketplace with 125 million active users that hosts thousands of popular games for PC. Each game on Steam has a corresponding web page that contains a brief description of the title, some keywords, some technical specifications, and finally several user written reviews. Each page also provides a link to twelve games deemed similar by Steam's own recommendation system.

This inherent connectedness can be interpreted as a graph with games as nodes and links as edges. We can then scrape this graph using a breadth first search. Having obtained the HTML from each page, we do some simple filtering by eliminating all tags, and then extracting all alphabetic tokens and converting them to lowercase. We use a stoplist to eliminate commonly used words.

![Image of LDA](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Smoothed_LDA.png)

Once we have the tokens from the pages, we can do topic detection using the LDA model. In the LDA model, we take the approach that each word w in each document is related to some topic z, where there are K possible topics in total. For each document there is a distribution theta over the frequency of each topic within that document. For each topic, there is a distribution phi over the probability of any word given that topic. We place Dirichlet priors on phi and theta with hyperparameters alpha and beta.

In order to learn this model, we can use Gibbs Sampling. Gibbs Sampling is an inference technique that works by repeatedly randomly sampling the latent variables (z in this case), and estimating the parameters based on the sampling. In effect, it takes a random walk through the sample space, and after enough iterations, its sampling distribution will converge towards a steady state which best describes the true distribution of the data.

## Results:

I obtained the following results on a dataset of 1247 titles, using 25 topics, hyperparameters 0.1 and 0.01 for alpha and beta respectively, and 1100 iterations of which 1000 were spent burning in the sampling chain to a stable distribution.

What you see below is a list for each topic of the words that are most likely to be generated by that topic, and another list for each topic of the documents (game pages on Steam) that had the highest proportion of that topic.

### Log Likelihood

![Log Likelihood](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45972570/Capture.PNG)

See the output files for specific learned parameter values.

### Simulated Data

I also created a set of simulated data (named test) using some artificial hyperparameters 0.5 and 0.5, 5 topics, and a vocabulary consisting of the letters a through j. On a corpus of 1000 documents, each with 500 words, the model was able to successfully recover the true parameters of the model with 2-3 decimal places of accuracy after running for 1100 iterations with 1000 to burn in. See the sim_data.py file for the details of how the artificial data was generated, and the files true and test_out for the actual and recovered parameters.

## Discussion:

We can see from the results that the Gibbs Sampler has done a pretty good job of uncovering some latent topics present in the Steam web pages. Note that not all of the topics necessarily correspond to genre; some appear to relate to elements of the reviews, and others are related to technical specifications. I'll now give a more detailed analysis of what I consider to be some of the most interesting and well formulated topics.

**Topic 0:**  
This topic is largely about RPG games, and we can see that clearly from the words associated with it. Interestingly, most of the games in this topic seem to have a divine and/or gothic twist to them.

**Topic 1:**  
This topic has grouped all of the zombie games. We can see strongly correlated words such as zombie, fps, ammo, etc. which we might expect. The games themselves fit this description for the most part, except for Rising Storm, which is a WWII game. Perhaps it's not all that strange as discussion of Nazi Zombies is much more prevalent on the internet that one might expect, and Rising Storm does in fact have several zombie themed mods.

**Topic 2:**  
This topic contains all of the games produced by Valve, which is incidentally the company that created Steam. Valve games tend to have strong cult followings, so it makes sense that we would see them all appear together here. Also, since Valve created Steam, it is understandable that the games made by Valve would be among the more popular ones on Steam.

**Topic 3:**  
Here we can see all of the words that are related to the system specifications required to play a game. Almost all of the terms are ones that you would expect to see in any discussion of PC specs. In this case, because the topic is not related to any particular genre, the games don't look very similar, but are probably all united in requiring very specific specifications to run.

**Topic 5:**  
This topic describes any notes on the page related to updates, bugs, and patches. Much like topic 3, this has nothing to do with genre, but it's possible that a game with a high proportion of this topic is particularly buggy.

**Topic 6:**  
I like this topic qutie a lot as it has nothing to do with the games. Instead, this topic captures all of the content about the gaming community, the reviews that people leave, their accounts, etc. Many of these terms are found in the template for all pages, so there's not much meaning that can be gleaned from the games correlated with it.

**Topic 7:**  
This topic is peculiar as it consists entirely of short meaningless words. In fact, it looks as though this topic is a catchall for any generic tokens that don't really fit into any of the other topics. Effectively, these are words that should be in our stopword list, but aren't. Clearly terms like game and play will show up on almost any page, but they're not common enough in English in general that they were included in our stoplist.

**Topic 11:**  
This topic is another one not direcly related to the genre, but rather to a specific component of the review. It specifically discusses the storyline of the game, the characters involved, and even the dialogue and voice acting. One could theoretically use information from topics like this to automatically segment reviews into chunks about story, gameplay, graphics, etc. and use that to perform summarization across multiple reviews.

**Topic 19:**  
Games in this topic are primarily free online multiplayers. We can see from the relevant words that there's a strong emphasis on teams, people, and community. Interestingly, this is one of only three topics in which the word "fun" is among the top listed.

**Topic 22:**  
These are the straight horror games, featuring dark, atmospheric worlds for the player to explore. Humorously, the word "nope" makes the top of the list. The games themselves are all classic PC horror titles including Outlast, Amnesia, and Slender.

## Conclusions and Future Work

In summary, we can see that the topic detector did a fantastic job at uncovering many of the basic genres, as well as identifying specific elements of the reviews and descriptions common to all games. It might be interesting to explore splitting the single hidden topic variable into two: one for the genre of the game, and one for the component of the page/review.

As stated above, I think it would be also worthwhile to improve the stoplist to better reflect the particular nomenclature for describing video games. This is especially important as the LDA model does not have a notion of weighting based on frequency. More generally, it might be interesting to see how we could incorporate a weighting scheme into the model, as we already know from the HTML which words are keywords, which are from the official description, and other such categories.

## Usage:

First run grab_info_steam.py to scrape the Steam library for data. You can terminate that process whenever you like, but I found that good results were obtained after scraping ~1200 titles, which may take close to half an hour depending on connectivity.

Then run run-LDA.sh to do inference on the LDA model using the collected data. In the results I have described, I ran it using K=25, alpha=0.1, beta=0.01, T=1100, and burnin=1000. The names of the input and output files are games and steam respectively.

You can then run analyze.py to print out a brief summary of the parameters that the model has learned. It takes as arguments the name file and output file which are called games-names and steam respectively by default.
